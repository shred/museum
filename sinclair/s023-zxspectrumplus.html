    <h1>Sinclair ZX Spectrum Plus</h1>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built: 1985 Q1</li>
<li>Mainboard: Issue 4B</li>
<li>CPU: Mostek Z80 (date code 8637)</li>
<li>ULA: 6C001E-7 (date code 8448, probably made in Philippines)</li>
<li>RAM: 48KB</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Was sold as &quot;defective because it cannot be turned on&quot;, which was correct.</li>
<li>Has a SN94459 video chip instead of an LM1889.</li>
<li>The system was probably repaired in 02/1987, where the CPU has been replaced with a Mostek Z80 CPU.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>One rib of the grille is broken out.</li>
<li>-5V line is missing, for unknown reason. Other voltages are fine. I already changed all the relevant parts, but could not restore it. On one end of R79, -8V is present, but on the other end it's just +0.5V. It started after washing the PCB, and one time I was able to restore the voltage while measuring, so it must be some kind of mechanical problem. I checked all solder joints and also resoldered all components, but it didn't help. (PS: The schematics are incorrect. It's basically like shown in &quot;Issue 4B&quot;, but with D19 and C79 swapped.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restauration Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>7805 was short and triggered the OCP of my power supply. After replacing it with a DC/DC converter, all voltages were back and the system started normally. Likely cause for this damage was an attempt to run the system with a power supply with wrong polarity.</li>
<li>System did not make a sound. After replacing TR7 and D9, sound was back. This might also have been caused by the wrong polarity.</li>
<li>Composite mod.</li>
<li>Case cleaned and some minor optical issues removed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<ul>
<li>2023-03-11
<ul>
<li>Reassembled the system</li>
<li>System suddenly does not start anymore because -5V is missing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2023-03-10
<ul>
<li>Replaced 7805 with DC/DC converter</li>
<li>Repaired missing sound</li>
<li>Composite mod</li>
<li>Case cleaned</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2023-03-05: Date of purchase</li>
</ul>
