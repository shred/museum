    <div class="alert alert-success fs-4 text-center">Status: <strong>Refurbished and working</strong></div>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built: 1984</li>
<li>Mainboard: Issue 4A</li>
<li>CPU: Z80A (date code 8422)</li>
<li>ULA: 6C001E-7 (date code 8416, probably made in Phillipines)</li>
<li>RAM: 48KB (OKI M3732H-20)</li>
<li>ROM: 16KB (NEC, socketed)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Was sold as untested. Came with a German introduction manual.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restauration Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Composite Mod</li>
<li>ULA was not properly seated.</li>
<li>IC26 pin 8 was bent and not properly put into the socket, fixed.</li>
<li>TV signal was almost black. -5V and 12V was missing. Checked coil, but it was OK. Replaced TR4, TR5 and D19. 12V rail had 7V. TR4 and IC8 were getting very hot.</li>
<li>Diagnostics identified IC9 and IC10 to be defective, too. They were replaced. 12V was fine after that. -5V rail was -4V though.</li>
<li>Machine has a modified DC/DC converter in Sinclairs final revision. However C47 was missing, soldered in a 1µF cap. -5V rail gave -4.2V after that, which is closely within tolerance.</li>
<li>Diagnostics showed that the AMI ROM was defective. Unsoldered it and soldered in a socket. Found an old NEC ROM in my spare part box, which worked fine.</li>
<li>Recapped the machine. 7805 and heatsink was replaced with a Traco Power DC/DC converter.</li>
<li>Case cleaned. Faceplate is clipped and was removed for cleaning.</li>
<li>Brittle membrane replaced with a replica.</li>
<li>Four case screws and the PCB screw were missing and have been replaced.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minor faceplate damage. I decided to keep it like that, to show that the machine has a history and was once bringing joy to its owner.</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<ul>
<li>2023-08-13:
<ul>
<li>Replaced two more defective lower RAMs.</li>
