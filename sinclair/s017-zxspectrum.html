    <div class="alert alert-success fs-4 text-center">Status: <strong>Working</strong></div>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built: 2023-01-07</li>
<li>Mainboard: Issue 3B Replica</li>
<li>CPU: Z80A</li>
<li>ULA: 6C001E-7 (date code 8625, probably made in UK)</li>
<li>RAM: 48KB</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>The original Issue 3 board was sold as defective and without the case. There was a reset wire and a switch, so I guess it was once in a ZX Spectrum Plus case. After that it might have served as an exhibit because it had some labels attached that were describing the components. A quick test showed that the ULA was working, but that <code>D0</code> was shorted to ground. There was some soldering done on the board, so maybe there was a short somewhere.</li>
<li>Although the board might have been repairable, I decided from the start to build up a replica ZX Spectrum from the recovered parts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<ul>
<li>2023-01-07:
<ul>
<li>Used MPS2369 as TR3, and the CPU clock was present.</li>
<li>Diagnostics said the original CPU was defective (missing <code>/M1</code>), replaced with new CPU.</li>
<li>New speaker got broken when I tried to fix it with hot glue. Removed it and used the original speaker instead.</li>
<li>Used a new transparent case with white keymat and faceplate. Assembled the system there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-12-29:
<ul>
<li>I found that the CPU clock is missing. It seems to be related to TR3, where I used a BC-548C as unconfirmed replacement type. Ordered a set of MPS2369, which are confirmed as working replacements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-12-25 - 2022-12-27:
<ul>
<li>Assembled the new board, with as many new parts as possible.</li>
<li>Power connector had a short circuit, was resolved when resoldering the DC/DC converter.</li>
<li>System does not start, only shows black and white columns on a magenta border.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-12-10:
<ul>
<li>Stripped rare parts from the board: Lower and Upper RAM chips, LM1889, CPU, speaker, keyboard connectors, coil.</li>
<li>1 lower RAM was damaged when I unsoldered it.</li>
<li>1 upper RAM was damaged when I unsoldered it. 5 more upper RAMs failed the memory test after unsoldering.</li>
<li>Many traces got damaged while unsoldering the components. The board is for the trash now, stored away as a souvenir.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-11-25: Bought a replica Issue 3B board (black with ENIG plating)</li>
<li>2022-11-22: Bought a defective Issue 3 board</li>
</ul>
