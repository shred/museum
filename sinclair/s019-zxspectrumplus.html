    <h1>Sinclair ZX Spectrum Plus</h1>
    <div class="alert alert-success fs-4 text-center">Status: <strong>Refurbished and working</strong></div>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built: 1983/Q1, upgraded to 48K in 1983/Q4, upgraded to Plus in 1984 or later</li>
<li>Mainboard: Issue Two</li>
<li>CPU: Z80A</li>
<li>ULA: 6C001E-6 (date code 8343, probably made in Philippines)</li>
<li>RAM: 48KB</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Got this machine in a bundle with an <a href="s020-interface1.html">Interface 1</a> and a <a href="s021-microdrive.html">Microdrive</a>.</li>
<li>This machine was probably build in 1983/Q1 as 16K ZX Spectrum, and was upgraded by Sinclair to 48K around 1983/Q4.</li>
<li>Instead of a serial number, the word &quot;Upgraded&quot; is embossed into the case. It means that the board was originally inside a ZX Spectrum &quot;rubber keys&quot; case. The system was then upgraded to a &quot;ZX Spectrum Plus&quot; in 1984 or later. This would explain why I found an &quot;Issue Two&quot; board (with a twisted heatsink) in a ZX Spectrum Plus case. Sinclair sold upgrade kits, but this machine had a German warranty sticker, so the upgrade was done by Sinclair.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speaker is very silent.</li>
<li>Cannot load from tape, signal is too weak.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restauration Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Restauration was carried out in January 2023.</li>
<li>-5V and 12V were missing. Fixed by replacing TR4 and D16. Strangely, the system was still starting without these voltages.</li>
<li>Recapping, Traco DC/DC converter, Composite Mod.</li>
<li>Case cleaned.</li>
<li>Membrane connector was broken off, so the membrane was replaced with a new replica.</li>
<li>Display had a greenish tint and a strange horizontal raster. Repaired by replacing IC14 and VR1.</li>
<li>Applied a heatsink to the ULA.</li>
<li>Perfect calibration of video quality and crystals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<ul>
<li>2023-01-22:
<ul>
<li>Replaced IC14 with a socket and a NOS LM1889N. Image quality was slightly improved.</li>
<li>Replaced VR1, which finally fixed the issue with the discoloration.</li>
<li>Reset wire was too short after recapping. Replaced with a new wire.</li>
<li>On the keyboard, the &quot;ASDFG&quot; keys did not respond. Replaced D3, but that didn't help. Fixed the issue by putting some tape behind the membrane contacts.</li>
<li>Applied a heatsink to the ULA.</li>
<li>Reassembled the system. Refurbishment is now completed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2023-01-21:
<ul>
<li>Cleaned the case</li>
<li>New keyboard membrane, as the connectors of the old one were broken off</li>
<li>Composite mod</li>
<li>Replaced 7805 with Traco Power DC/DC converter</li>
<li>-5V and 12V were bad, fixed by replacing TR4 and D16</li>
<li>Recapped</li>
<li>Diagnostics detected a 16K model. Checked all chips related to upper RAM, but eventually found a drop of solder as cause. IC16, IC17 and IC21 were detected as faulty by the Retro Chip Tester, but seem to work fine in the machine, so I kept them.</li>
<li>Display has a greenish tint and horizontal disturbances. Tried to fix it by replacing D15, TR1, TR2. Also swapped ULA, but it didn't change anything.</li>
<li>Cleaned in IPA bath. Broke off speaker when I tried to bend it up so it won't have contact to IPA, and resoldered it after the bath.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2023-01-10: Date of purchase</li>
