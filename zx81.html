    <h1>Sinclair ZX81</h1>
    <p>Around 1982, I got my very first home computer, a ZX81. I learned how to program computers on it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my original ZX81 does not exist any more. I broke it by attempting to do hardware modificiations, and eventually disposed it. Today I regret that I haven't shown more respect to my first computer.</p>
<p>I found this ZX81 at an online auction. It is in a good optical condition, and is looking very similar to the system I once had myself. This is why I bought it. According to the seller, it was assumed to be in working order, but untested.</p>
<p>The 16K RAM expansion that was sold along with this ZX81 was said to be definitely broken. It turned out that the seller was correct, as the RAM expansion had a broken ULA chip and couldn't be repaired. Luckily I have found a similar RAM expansion at another auction, so the set is complete and working now.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built: Around 1983/1984</li>
<li>Mainboard: Issue 3</li>
<li>CPU: Z80A</li>
<li>ULA: 2C210E (date code 8312)</li>
<li>RAM: 1KB (internal), 16KB (expansion)</li>
<li>Composite Mod</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restauration Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Restauration was carried out in December 2021</li>
<li>Case cleaned</li>
<li>Modified the modulator to create a composite signal, reversible</li>
<li>All electrolytic capacitors replaced with new, long-live types</li>
<li>Replaced 7805 with Traco Power TSR-1 DC/DC converter, and removed heatsink</li>
<li>ULA and CPU heatsinked</li>
<li>Keyboard membrane connector broke off during restauration due to old age, but could be recovered</li>
<li>Original 16KB RAM expansion could not be repaired and was replaced by another RAM expansion (also recapped)</li>
</ul>
