    <h1>Sinclair QL</h1>
    <p>The Sinclair QL was the high-end counterpart of the ZX Spectrum and was meant to be a &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;. It was aimed at serious home computer owners and businesses. However the launch was rather &quot;quite late&quot;, and also overly rushed. When the QL was finally ready for the market, it had to compete against the Amiga or Atari ST, which had much more potent hardware.</p>
<p>I found this Sinclair QL at an online auction for a good price. The previous owner had a lot of expertise, so the set was fairly complete, including all Microdrive tapes, manuals, Minerva ROMs, and a Scart monitor adapter. Overall, this machine is in a very good shape, and does not needs to be much restauration. It came in the original package.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built: Around 1984/1985</li>
<li>Mainboard: Issue 1</li>
<li>CPU: MC68008, 7.5 MHz</li>
<li>RAM: 128 KB</li>
<li>English keyboard layout</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>The left microdrive motor has a damaged bearing, and needs replacement.</li>
<li>The capacitors are the original ones, which might have dried out.</li>
<li>The original 7805 is working at its load limit and needs a big heatsink. It should be replaced with a Traco Power TSR-2 DC/DC converter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restauration Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>ROM port cover was missing, and was replaced by a 3D printed replica.</li>
<li>Top case and keyboard was cleaned.</li>
<li>Original keyboard membrane was brittle due to old age, and was replaced by a new replica one.</li>
<li>Original UK style power plug has been replaced with a DIY European plug. I didn't trust the new plug, so I replaced it again with an European plug with a proper pull relief.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>The QL had a palette of only 8 colors and no sound chip, making it even inferior to the Spectrum 128K regarding games.</li>
</ul>
