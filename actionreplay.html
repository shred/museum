    <h1>Datel Electronics Ltd Action Replay</h1>
    <p>The <em>Action Replay</em> is a &quot;cheating device&quot; made for the Amiga 500 by Datel. By pressing the red button, a monitor software can be invoked in every situation, also in-game. This monitor permits to analyze and change the assembler code, so cheat codes (e.g. infinite lives) can be found and applied.</p>
<p>I bought this Action Replay MK1 at an online auction in November 2021. The seller claimed he got it from a friend who said it is working, but he never tested it himself, so he sold it as defective. In fact, the case was dirty and cracked open at one side. The PCB was filthy and had probably been exposed to a liquid like coke. There is also a drop damage, with one corner of the PCB dented, and the head of the potentiometer missing (presumedly snapped off and then got lost). One could see that this piece of hardware was once heavily used.</p>
<p>After cleaning and replacing all damaged or dirty parts, it turned out that the Action Replay is in fact working fine.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built: End of 1990</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restauration Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Case thorougly cleaned in an ultrasonic bath.</li>
<li>PCB thorougly cleaned in an ultrasonic bath and washed with IPA.</li>
<li>Replaced all mechanical parts (switch, key, potentiometer) and the LEDs. The original black potentiometer head was a proprietary type. I replaced it with a standard potentiometer head that was unfortunately only available in white.</li>
<li>Replaced the two electrolytic caps with standard miniature types.</li>
<li>Fixed the case with a drop of superglue (it can hopefully still be opened).</li>
</ul>
