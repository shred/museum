    <h1>Sinclair ZX Spectrum</h1>
    <p>I bought this machine as a bundle of Sinclair hardware in February 2022. It came with the original PSU. It has been stored away for a long time, as it was quite filthy and had a few scratches. It had a label with an inventory date of March 19th, 1985 (removed now).</p>
<p>The computer was untested when sold. The diagnostics showed that it is basically working, but had two defective upper RAM chips.</p>
<p>The keymat was filthy and had a strong smell of moist. I decided to keep the keymat, but use a new standard black replica faceplate.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built: Early 1983</li>
<li>Mainboard: Issue Two</li>
<li>CPU: Z80A</li>
<li>ULA: 5C112E (date code 8304, probably made in Phillipines)</li>
<li>RAM: 48KB</li>
<li>Came with an original PSU with EU plug (cleaned, untested, unrefurbished)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Output signal has a yellow tint even after calibration. Colors are completely broken. This may be due to the back porch bug of ULA type 5.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restauration Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Restauration was carried out between February and March 2022.</li>
<li>Thorough cleaning of the case. I also removed a security sticker that had been attached by the previous owner. It was very difficult to remove, and unfortunately left a lot of scratches on the bottom shell.</li>
<li>The keyboard membrane connector was broken due to old age, and was replaced.</li>
<li>The faceplate got bent on my attempt to remove it, and was replaced with a new replica one.</li>
<li>Replaced two upper RAM chips that were reported as faulty.</li>
<li>Replaced 7805 with Traco Power TSR-1 DC/DC converter, removed heatsink</li>
<li>Recapping, Composite Mod</li>
<li>Calibrated video output</li>
</ul>
