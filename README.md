This GitHub project only contains the source code of the museum.

If you like the museum, I am happy to receive a star. You can also watch this project for further updates.

However, all files in this project are generated by a proprietary tool. There is not much use in forking the project. I won't accept Pull Requests, and will close them uncommented.
