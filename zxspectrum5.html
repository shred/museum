    <h1>Sinclair ZX Spectrum</h1>
    <p>I bought this machine as a bundle of Sinclair hardware in February 2022. It came with the original box, PSU and cables. According to the price label on the box, the system was originally bought at Harrods for £129.95. It has been stored away for a long time, as it was quite filthy.</p>
<p>The computer was untested when sold. The diagnostics showed that the system was fully functional.</p>
<p>The PSU is an UK model that was later modified to get an Euro power plug. There is a label on it that says that the unit has been &quot;re-checked after the recall of 26/2/83&quot;. Actually there has been a major recall of Sinclair PSUs after some faulty units with a poor galvanic isolation were found that were potentially hazardous.</p>
<p>After I only owned Issue Two boards so far, this is my first Speccy with an Issue Three board.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built: End of 1983</li>
<li>Mainboard: Issue Three</li>
<li>CPU: Z80A</li>
<li>ULA: 6C001E-6 (date code 8341, probably made in Phillipines)</li>
<li>RAM: 48KB</li>

<li>Came with an original PSU with UK plug that was later changed to an EU plug (cleaned, untested, unrefurbished)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restauration Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Restauration was carried out between February and March 2022.</li>
<li>Thorough cleaning of the case. I also removed a security sticker that had been attached by the previous owner.</li>
<li>The keyboard membrane was intact, but one connector heavily bent, so I replaced it with a new membrane.</li>
<li>Faceplate replaced with a metallic blue one.</li>
<li>Replaced 7805 with Traco Power TSR-1 DC/DC converter, removed heatsink</li>
<li>Recapping, Composite Mod</li>
<li>Video calibration not possible/not required on Issue Three boards</li>
</ul>
