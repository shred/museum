    <h1>Sharp IQ-7100M</h1>
    <p>In 1994, I bought a Sharp IQ-8300M Electronic Organizer to keep track of appointments and phone numbers. These were the ancients of modern smartphones, in a manner of speaking. I extended it with the IQ-8B03 BASIC card, so I could also use it as scientific calculator, and write small BASIC programs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the synthetic leather exterior is starting to deteriorate after a few decades. I accidentally accelerated the process by storing the device in a box that seemed to exude plasticizers. When I took it out again some day, the entire outer shell had softened and was sticky like honey, rendering the device useless. I decided to dispose it. What I kept was the BASIC card.</p>
<p>Later I found this IQ-7100M for a good price at an online auction house, so I bought this one as a replacement. The exterior is still intact, and thanks to the experience I made, I now store it in a dark and dry cardboard box.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unknown build date, first half of the 1990s</li>
<li>96 x 64 pixel dot matrix monochrome LCD</li>
<li>32KB RAM</li>
<li>IQ-8B03 &quot;Scientific Computer Card BASIC&quot; with extended math operations and separate 32KB BASIC RAM</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restauration Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>None, except of a bit of careful cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>Wizard</em> organizer series was called <em>IQ</em> in Europe, but <em>OZ</em> in the USA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BASIC also offers <code>PEEK</code> and <code>POKE</code> commands, with access to the entire ROM and RAM area. (If I remember correctly, I could even read protected records that way, without having to give the password.) I never found a command for jumping to a memory address, and also found no documentation about the instruction set of the proprietary Sharp CPU. Otherwise it would have even been possible to program the organizer in assembler.</p>

</ul>
