    <h1>Commodore Amiga 1000</h1>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built: Q1 1986 for the US market (NTSC), Q1 1987 modified for EU market (PAL), Made in Japan</li>
<li>Mainboard: Standard revision, with daughterboard</li>
<li>CPU: HD68000P8</li>
<li>Chipset: OCS
<ul>
<li>Agnus: MOS 8367R0 (0687)</li>
<li>Denise: MOS 8362R6 (5185, ceramic)</li>
<li>Paula: MOS 8364R4 (0486, ceramic)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>System clock: 28.6363 MHz (NTSC)</li>
<li>RAM: 256KB RAM + 256KB Expansion</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Only <a href="https://www.amigawiki.org/doku.php?id=de:history:sales_volume">27,500 Amiga 1000</a> have ever been sold in Germany. This was probably one of the first Amigas sold in this country.</li>
<li>Came with the keyboard (French layout with stickers for German layout, as it was common at that time) and the original Amiga monitor. The original mouse and the floppy disks are missing. The keyboard got new German keycaps from a donor keyboard later. I also got a replacement mouse.</li>
<li>Although the system has been modified for the PAL standard, it still uses the NTSC system clock. For this reason, the generated TV signal is not truly PAL, and the system is a bit faster than other PAL Amigas.</li>
<li>The audio and composite RCA connectors are all white, which is another indication that this is one of the first Amigas that have been built.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restauration Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cleaned and whitened the case of the main unit and keyboard, as well as the keycaps.</li>
<li>Completely overhauled the keyboard. It was extremely filthy, with flash rust, insect excrements and dead bugs. Sanded down the keyboard frame, and gave it a fresh spray paint. Checked all key switches, repaired more than half of them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Two of the inside eyelets are broken, so the case top is not tightly closed. Can be fixed with a simple 3D print glued to the eyelet with superglue.</li>
<li>The &quot;D&quot; key gets stuck when pressed. The switch should be replaced.</li>
<li>The mouse Y axis does not work. Also the mouse needs cleaning and whitening.</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<ul>
<li>2023-03-19
<ul>
<li>Bought an A1000 mouse with right-angled plug. Now the Amiga hardware is complete again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-12-26
<ul>
<li>Assembled a replica A1000 cardboard box, and stored the Amiga inside it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-12-22
<ul>
<li>Removed the original white keycaps, and replaced them with the keycaps of the German keyboard. The grey keycaps, metal levers, and metal lever holders are still original.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-12-11
<ul>
<li>Removed and cleaned the keycaps of the German keyboard</li>
<li>Rest of the German keyboard is stored away as spare part donor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-11-20
<ul>
<li>Got hands on a defective A1000 keyboard with German layout</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-11-01
<ul>
<li>Ordered a replica cardboard box</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-10-30
<ul>
<li>Printed a corrected GOEX frame</li>
<li>Assembled everything</li>
<li>Removed the protective film from the Amiga badges</li>
<li>Created an SD Card with a Kickstart disk, so the Amiga is booting from that disk automatically</li>
<li>Ran the Diagnostics disk without errors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-10-29
<ul>
<li>Replaced power and drive LED with fresh ones</li>
<li>Soldered a drive LED connector to the GOEX drive. The drive LED was connected to the floppy before, so there was no connector for it when the floppy was removed.</li>
<li>Soldered two wires for CSYNC and RGB to the mainboard, to enable the OSD feature of the GOEX drive.</li>
<li>Put it all together. Unfortunately the GOEX frame was a bit too high, so the encoder dial was blocked by the front bezel and could not be pressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-08-14
<ul>
<li>Mounted the refurbished PSU</li>
<li>Cleaned the main board and piggyback board with IPA</li>
<li>Mounted the piggyback board to the main board</li>
<li>Replaced the missing lock screw on one port</li>
<li>Assembled most of the system, except of floppy and top shield</li>
<li>First system test was successful!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-08-06 ~ 2022-08-09
<ul>
<li>Sanded down keyboard metal frame, and spray painted it with fresh matte-black paint.</li>
<li>All switches unsoldered and tested. More than half of the switches either did not close the connection, or the plunger kept stuck. I opened all defective switches, cleaned the contact, greased the plunger with silicone grease, and then reassembled the switch. Each repaired switch is marked on the base. For the &quot;Del&quot; key, I lost the spring. It was replaced with a NOS switch. All switches are now tested and working.</li>
<li>Cleaned liquid stains from the keyboard PCB.</li>
<li>Reassembled the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-07-31
<ul>
<li>Recapped and cleaned both PCBs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-07-17
<ul>
<li>First check</li>
<li>Parts of case cleaned and carefully sun whitened</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022-07-16: Picked up at the seller</li>
<li>2022-07-10: Date of purchase</li>
</ul>
